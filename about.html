			Hello, I'm Vincent van Hannen. I was born and raised in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. 
<br>
<br>			 
			From a young age, I’ve always had an interest in video and photography. It all started 
			with a kid’s camera, and later an action cam. I found it so fascinating that I even 
			gave a school presentation about it. Unfortunately, during my high school years, this 
			hobby received less attention. However, when I began studying journalism, my passion 
			for it started to return.
<br>
<br>
			During my studies, I discovered that I really enjoyed taking photos. I began studying 
			more about cameras and worked to take my photography to the next level. This led me to 
			practice photography almost daily. With my Canon 250D, I aimed to capture the most 
			beautiful images. Then, during a videography assignment for school, I decided to use 
			this same camera and realized that I enjoyed making moving images even more than taking photos.
<br>
<br>
			Now, some time has passed. I’ve replaced my Canon 250D with a Sony A7Cii and gained more 
			experience along the way. Feel free to browse through my portfolio and discover the stories 
			I’ve captured. If you're interested in collaborating or have any questions, don’t hesitate 
			to get in touch!
